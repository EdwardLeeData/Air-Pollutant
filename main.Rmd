## Part 1: Function named 'pollutantmean' that calculates the mean of a pollutant (sulfate or nitrate) across a specified list of monitors.
```{r}
poulltantmean <- function (directory, pollutant, id = 1:332){
  ## 'directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating the location of the CSV files
  
  ## 'pollutant' is a character vector of length 1 indicating the name of the pollutant for which we will calculate the mean; either "sulfate" or "nitrate".
  
  ## 'id' is an integer vector indicating the monitor ID numbers to be used
  
  ## return the mean of the pollutant across all monitors list in the 'id' vector (ignoring NA values)
  ## note: do not round the result!
  
  
}
```
